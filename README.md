# tagged-releases-test

![](https://travis-ci.org/daniellivingston/tagged-releases-test.svg?branch=master)

A sample repo for testing tagged releases on Travis CI and GitHub Releases.

On any push of a `git tag`, TravisCI deploys Linux and macOS binaries to GitHub Releases.
This template can be used to easily generate major/minor release binaries with no extra work.
